# Culture at Spotify just blew me away!
We've been going through some growing pains at work and so lately I've been getting very interested in scaling Agile.  In my search, a friend recently recommended this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpsn3WaI_4k) from Spotify. It's absolutely amazing! One of the best things I think I have ever watched. Its jammed packed with all sorts of gems on how to be a more effective team and organisation and delivered in a concise and easy to understand format. Bravo Spotify, Bravo!
