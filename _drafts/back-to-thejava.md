# Back to the Java
Been using Ruby and Scala and looking into all sorts of things lately but recently been getting back into Java. Have to say I am surprised at how easy it has been to pick it back up again. Was last using it years ago and its very similar. It's slow rate of change was one of its big drawbacks to me but now I'm very grateful for that when picking it back up again. This is in start contrast to something like Spark which has changed drastically in even the 9 months I have been learning it.
