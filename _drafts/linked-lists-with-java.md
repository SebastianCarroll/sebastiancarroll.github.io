# Linked Lists With Java
Second thing to try while practicing Java was the quintessential 'Reverse A Linked List' task. I had given this a shot years ago but thought I would give it another shot without referencing my [previous work](https://github.com/SebastianCarroll/AlgorithmsForJava/blob/master/src/Misc/linkedList/LList.java)

First step was to get the basic linked lisk data structure working and be able to add some elements to it. Second to that I wanted some way to see what was in my linked list so added a print statement. More than anything this was just so I could debug the first method.

Then comes the hard part

TODO: Describe the process of getting the reverse ll going

And finally to make it generic

TODO: Copy the errors here and post resolution
