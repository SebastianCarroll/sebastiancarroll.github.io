# My First Attempt at Preparing for a Conference Talk
* Come up with a good idea
* Gotten an internal run out
* Made public with meetup talk
* Revised based on new knowledge and features
* The hard part:
* Acutlaly doing the talk and demo. It has to work. It has to be more polished. I don't want to go in there with with bad practice I want it to be amazing. Would have liked to have the talk already down and just work on the delivery.

## Steps
* getting teh demo repeatable
* Vagrant - setting up machines
*
