# Liards and Local Maxima
We watched the second part of the "Mountains" documentary series last night and I had a pretty nice thought. There were lizards that had evolved to be very good at finding water on the salt flats in the andes by catching flies. Initially I thought 'oh wow they are doing really well there given how harsh it is' but then I thought well if you took it somewhere else would it do better? is it in a local minima? E.g.
the toad cane? It has thrived all over australia and despite decent efforts to stop it, its march can't be stopped. Its so well suited to the env that its growth is explosive. This also applies to people in c
areers. Some people have gottne very good at what they do but are no better off than a lot of others lucky enough to be average in a sort after career. I wonder how many people are stuck in local minimas? Its
 fairly common to not know what other people earn and its a risk to change careers. Businesses want to put up walls to stop people dabbling in other industries just like the andes mountain rangers made it dif
 ficult for the lizard to see that just over the hill there are areas rich in water. Why struggle here when you can moce there? Well you can't see so you assume that you are doing well
