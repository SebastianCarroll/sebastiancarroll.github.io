# Kaizen and Compound Interest

## Outline
Standard business improvement - The standard interest of business improvement lies in,  people telling other people what to do and how you get some business improvement.
Kaizen - According to Kaizen principle, improvement is the responsibility of everyone. Everyone should contribute towards improvement all the time. Thus it is like compound interest where the improvement is compounded over time.
Relating - Compound interest is amazing and is worth investing even with modest expected returns-5-10%. People find it very impressive that they can ususally expect returns anywhere from 25 to 50 or sometimes even 100 % increment with small changes. These can then be reinvested.
Though Kaizan is not exactly equivalent to compund interest, it is a very close analogy where improvement is driven by learning and interest. So, the metaphor makes sense. Kaizen should be the base of a learning organization.

## Traditional Improvement Initiatives
The standard improvement initiatives I have seen usually involves an external team that identifies some area of the business that could be improved. Usually, there is some expected benefit and some expected cost, where the project will be approved if the benefit is higher than the cost plus some risk margin.  When I think about this, I always think this is analogous to the idea of Simple Interest[^si], where some money or principal is invested with some expected gains.  In our improvement case, we invest some time and money with the hope of helping employees in a way that makes them more productive. The project is conducted once and then the affected employees should be more productive going forward. In the interest analogy we would invest some principal, wait the allotted time and collect the interest. I see this case like interest with no replacement because the rewards gained (higher productivity) are not then being reinvested, they are just being extracted as higher margins.

## Kaizen and Continuous Improvement?
The principle of Kaizan improvement may be directly translated to English, regardless of its size or repetition frequency. However it has become synonymous with the Continuous Improvement philosophy spearheaded by Toyota[^toyota]. There are a number of improvements that the Kaizen way brings to the table, however I believe that the strongest one is the idea that continual improvement is everyone's responsibility. All workers at all levels are involved in continous improvement of the business and the workplace. This is important as the employees who are striving for improvement are also the ones reaping the benefit of that improvement.

## Compounding Interest
Compound interest is really amazing and almost universal, powering much of the modern economy. It revolves around lending or investing money (the principal) and then earning interest on that principal. The magic happens as you start re-investing the interest earned and the total amount starts growing exponentially. The earnings increase with each cycle despite the interest rate itself staying constant. For example, with and interest rate of 10% annually, the principal will double in just 7 years! Using simple interest, it would take 10 years. In business, this concept is very well understood.

## Compounding Improvement
The difference between simple interest and compounding interest is staggering. This is exactly the same difference as there is between normal investment in learning and continuous improvement.

Traditional investment in learning assumes that the team being improved continues to work as usual but with the extra bonus in productivity.  Kaizen on the other hand, makes improvement of all the buiness employees. But to fulfill this requirement they cannot take lengthy lead times to investigate and improve large sections of their daily work. Instead they must dedicate small amounts of time to identify and improve small areas of the business. This continuous application is where it is relatable to compounding interest because the employees themselves are able to reinvest the time they save into themselves and their work.

## People are not machines
The potential gains are much much higher when investing in people. With money or assets, financial returns are usually very well known in advance. They might fluctuate by a few percent per year but are generally very predictable. But this also means they are generally low. Standard loans range from 1-6% and other types of investment (such as managed funds) might see 13%. Any returns higher than this would be unusual. People on the other hand are much more variable than that and the gains are also potentially much higher. A well oiled team with a focus on improvement could see returns of orders of magnitudes higher than standard interest rates. Something as simple as an MVP could see your idea efficiently validated at a thousandth of the cost of a full project (maybe a millionth)!
